expectedUserBehavior:
  - Standard ACP resource_link and URI-backed resource content renders as paperclip attachment cards.
  - Explicit assistant OpenClaw MEDIA directives omitted by ACP are recovered for live completions and historical session loads without displaying the raw directive.
  - MEDIA recovery remains aligned when the triggering ACP user turn contains structured resources, images, or no text.
  - Attachment rows render after assistant prose and preserve declaration order.
  - User image attachments render as thumbnails with a filename overlay on hover.
  - User non-image attachments show their source path after the filename, omit MIME text, and truncate long paths.
  - Supported session-valid local files, including paths outside the active workspace, open in the right-side Preview panel after a user click.
  - Unsupported session-valid local files open with the operating system default application after a user click.
  - HTTP and HTTPS attachments open externally after a user click.
  - Arbitrary paths in ordinary prose do not become attachments.
  - Unavailable or unauthorized references cannot be previewed or opened and do not suppress assistant prose or other attachments.

acceptance:
  - A standard ACP resource_link or URI-backed resource renders an actionable paperclip attachment card.
  - User image attachments render as thumbnails with the filename revealed by a hover overlay.
  - User non-image attachments render the filename followed by a muted, truncating source path and no MIME label.
  - The reported OpenClaw MEDIA directive for budget_sample.xlsx renders an attachment in ACP Chat even though OpenClaw ACP emits no resource block.
  - User resource links and attachment-only prompts do not prevent the same turn's assistant MEDIA attachment from rendering.
  - The raw MEDIA directive is not displayed.
  - The attachment renders after assistant prose and preserves declaration order.
  - Supported files open in the right-side Preview panel.
  - Unsupported session-valid local files open with the system default application after a click.
  - HTTP and HTTPS attachments open externally after a click.
  - Arbitrary prose paths do not become attachments.
  - Existing local references outside the workspace can be previewed or opened after exact session/generation validation and per-operation Main re-resolution.
  - Live and historical paths deduplicate and reject stale session or generation results.
  - Native ACP resources take precedence over transcript compatibility evidence.
  - Attachment access remains bound to Main-owned session, generation, target revalidation, and outgoing-record authority on every operation.
  - Attachment rows use semantic controls with safe accessible labels, keyboard activation, and disabled unavailable states.
  - The implementation contains the required compatibility rationale comment and links it to durable architecture documentation.
  - No OpenClaw source or distributed package is modified.
  - No legacy Chat renderer, direct Renderer IPC, or direct Gateway HTTP request is introduced.
  - Unit, Electron E2E, typecheck, harness, and required communication regression checks pass.

## Scope

Standard ACP resource content is the preferred attachment source. The OpenClaw transcript path is a bounded compatibility exception for explicit assistant `MEDIA:` directives that the distributed ACP adapter omits; it is not a second Chat history source.

## Out Of Scope

- Modifying OpenClaw or its distributed package.
- Reconstructing ordinary messages, tools, plans, permissions, thoughts, or file activity from transcripts.
- Extracting bare paths or inline paths from ordinary assistant prose.
- Persisting a synthetic ACP attachment ledger or compatibility cache.
