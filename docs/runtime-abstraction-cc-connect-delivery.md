# ClawX Runtime Abstraction and cc-connect Delivery Readiness

## Delivery Status

Status: local implementation complete; release readiness incomplete

The current validation set is enough to support code review and local engineering confidence. It is not enough to claim production release readiness because full Electron package artifacts, cross-platform cc-connect resources, remote CI, and real-runtime parity checks have not all been completed.

## Validation Sufficiency

| Question | Current Answer | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Is the implementation locally coherent? | Yes | Typecheck, focused unit tests, Settings E2E, comms regression, and diff checks pass. |
| Is OpenClaw rollback protected? | Mostly yes | OpenClaw remains default and GatewayManager is wrapped, not removed. A full OpenClaw app smoke is still recommended before PR merge. |
| Is cc-connect packaging proven for this machine? | Partially | `bundle:cc-connect:current` produced and verified darwin-arm64 binary. |
| Is packaged ClawX proven offline-ready? | No | `package:mac:local` resource verification has not been run. |
| Are Windows and Linux packages proven? | No | They require CI or platform-specific package validation. |
| Is cc-connect feature parity proven? | Partial | Chat/session/history plus OpenAI API key, OpenAI OAuth/Codex, and Ollama provider/model selection are validated; channel/cron parity still needs runtime-specific validation. |
| Is PR/CI delivery complete? | No | No commit, push, PR, or remote CI was requested or created. |

## Completed Local Evidence

Passed local checks:

- `pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/runtime-manager.test.ts tests/unit/cc-connect-runtime-provider.test.ts tests/unit/cc-connect-provider-profile.test.ts tests/unit/codex-cli-bridge.test.ts tests/unit/cc-connect-bundle.test.ts tests/unit/host-api-facade.test.ts`
- `pnpm run typecheck`
- `pnpm run build:vite && pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/cc-connect-codex-runtime.spec.ts tests/e2e/settings-runtime-selector.spec.ts`
- `pnpm harness validate --spec harness/specs/tasks/runtime-abstraction-cc-connect.md`
- `pnpm run harness:ci`
- `pnpm run comms:replay && pnpm run comms:compare`
- `pnpm run bundle:cc-connect:current`
- `build/cc-connect/darwin-arm64/cc-connect --version`
- i18n JSON parse check
- `git diff --check`

Focused scan result:

- `gitleaks` and `detect-secrets` were not available.
- A fallback changed-file scan found field-name and documentation matches such as token/API key labels.
- No credential values were identified.

## Implementation Delivered

Runtime/backend:

- `RuntimeKind`, runtime capabilities, and runtime-aware status.
- `RuntimeManager`.
- `OpenClawRuntimeProvider` wrapping existing Gateway behavior.
- `CcConnectRuntimeProvider` with managed config, provider profile sync, binary path resolution, process lifecycle, logs, status, unsupported fallbacks, and Doctor diagnose.
- OpenAI OAuth/Codex mode writes a managed `CODEX_HOME/auth.json` under app userData and passes `CODEX_HOME` to Codex without relying on user `~/.codex`.
- Codex child processes in cc-connect mode inherit ClawX proxy environment values, including `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, and bypass rules.
- Runtime-aware host services while preserving legacy gateway IPC.

UI:

- Settings runtime selector.
- Runtime status, config directory, and capability visibility.
- Runtime Doctor surface.
- cc-connect mode keeps Doctor diagnose available and disables Doctor Fix because `cc-connect@1.3.2` lacks a fix subcommand.

Packaging:

- Locked `cc-connect@1.3.2` as a devDependency.
- Build-time bundler scripts.
- Electron `extraResources` configuration for platform resources.
- Current-platform bundle manifest and version verification.

Docs/tests:

- Architecture and migration doc.
- Proposal doc.
- Delivery readiness doc.
- README sync.
- Unit and E2E coverage.

## Missing Release Evidence

These items should remain open before declaring production release readiness:

| Missing Evidence | Required Command or Action | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Full macOS packaged resource check | `pnpm run package:mac:local`, then verify `ClawX.app/Contents/Resources/cc-connect/cc-connect --version` | Release owner |
| Windows packaged resource check | CI or Windows runner verifies `resources/cc-connect/cc-connect.exe --version` | CI/release owner |
| Linux packaged resource check | CI or Linux runner verifies `resources/cc-connect/cc-connect --version` | CI/release owner |
| OpenClaw default app smoke | Start app with default runtime and verify existing chat/session surfaces still load | QA/release owner |
| cc-connect packaged smoke | Start packaged app with cc-connect selected and verify runtime status/log/doctor | QA/release owner |
| Channel/cron parity decision | Decide which cc-connect channel and cron capabilities are supported, disabled, or deferred | Runtime owner |
| Remote CI | Commit, push, open PR, and observe terminal checks or record async follow-up | PR owner |

## Delivery Gate Ledger

| Gate | Status | Evidence | Release Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 Requirements | pass with process exception | `.delivery/runs/runtime-abstraction-cc-connect/requirements.md` | Requirements are specific enough; Mobius was invoked after initial implementation. |
| G2 Plan / Proposal | pass after supplement | `docs/runtime-abstraction-cc-connect-proposal.md`; `.delivery/runs/runtime-abstraction-cc-connect/plan.md` | Architecture review can proceed. |
| G3 Local Development | pass | Linked worktree and branch recorded. | Local changes isolated from main checkout. |
| G4 Implementation | pass | Runtime, UI, packaging, docs, and tests changed intentionally. | Ready for review. |
| G5 Verification | pass for local scope | Commands listed above. | Enough for local confidence, not enough for production release. |
| G6 PR/MR | not applicable | No commit/push/PR requested. | Required before normal merge workflow. |
| G7 CI/CD | not applicable | No remote head SHA exists. | Required before merge/release. |
| G8 Report | pass after supplement | `docs/runtime-abstraction-cc-connect-delivery.md`; `.delivery/runs/runtime-abstraction-cc-connect/delivery-report.md` | Delivery state is auditable. |

## Go / No-Go

Code review readiness: go

Alpha or internal validation: go, if testers accept capability-gated cc-connect behavior and OpenClaw rollback remains available.

Production release readiness: no-go until the missing release evidence above is completed.

## Handoff Checklist

Before PR:

- Review diff for runtime boundary and OpenClaw compatibility.
- Decide whether to keep `.delivery/` ignored or attach its report externally.
- Commit with a scoped message.
- Push and open PR.

Before merge:

- Run remote CI.
- Confirm macOS package resource check.
- Confirm no renderer direct runtime HTTP calls were introduced.
- Confirm unsupported cc-connect features are disabled or return stable errors.

Before release:

- Complete platform package checks.
- Run OpenClaw default smoke.
- Run cc-connect packaged smoke.
- Record final release notes and rollback instructions.
